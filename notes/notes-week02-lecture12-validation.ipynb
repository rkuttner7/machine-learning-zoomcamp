    "In general, the dataset is splitted into three parts: training, validation, and test. For each partition, we need to obtain feature matrices (X) and vectors of targets (y). First, the size of the partitions is calculated. Next, the records are shuffled to ensure that the values in the three partitions contain non-sequential records from the dataset. Finally, the partitions are created using the shuffled indices.\n",
