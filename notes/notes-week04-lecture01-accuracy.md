## Notes

**Accuracy** measures the fraction of correct predictions. Specifically, it is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.
    * Accuracy is not sensitive to class imbalance.  

### **Functions and methods:**   
  
* `np.linspace(x,y,z)` - returns a numpy array starting at `x` until `y` with `z` evenly spaced samples  
* `Counter(x)` - collection class that counts the number of instances that satisfy the x condition  
* `accuracy_score(x, y)` - `sklearn.metrics` class for calculating the accuracy of a model, given a predicted `x` and a target `y`.
