### Survival analysis

* Refit the 'Telco Customer churn' data using a [survival model](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quickstart.html) to predict the probability of churn for a given tenure. Compare predictions to the logistic regression model. (See [worked example](https://www.thomasjpfan.com/2018/09/survival-regression-analysis-on-customer-churn/) for guidance)
