### Survival analysis

* Refit the 'Telco Customer churn' data using a [survival model](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quickstart.html) to predict the probability of churn for a given tenure. Compare predictions to the logistic regression model. (See [worked example](https://www.thomasjpfan.com/2018/09/survival-regression-analysis-on-customer-churn/) for guidance)  
* [Tensorflow: Dealing with Survival Data | Blog Yishu Xue](https://yxue-me.com/post/2019-10-06-tensorflow-for-statisticians-2020/) worked example for implementing accelerated failure time model.  
* [Survival analysis, censoring and hacking the log_prob in TensorFlow Probability | Blog Adam Haber](https://adamhaber.github.io/post/survival-analysis/) worked example using a simple exponential distribution for the event times  
  
### Deep Learning  

* [Imagenet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) instrumental in advancing computer vision and deep learning research.  
* [Pre-trained models | Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/) Keras Applications are deep learning models that are made available alongside pre-trained weights. These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning.
